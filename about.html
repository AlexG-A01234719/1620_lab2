        <p>
            Hello dear readers, and welcome to my webpage. My name is Alex Guo, and I love building gundam plastic models, playing video games, and reading a good book.
            Remember, good <i>is</i> subjective! Even then, there are not many good things left on this world, so may yourself be one that you shall hold dear, and never lose it.
